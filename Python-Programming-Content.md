# Python Programming

## Course Objectives
The course is designed to provide Basic knowledge of Python. Python programming is intended for software engineers, system analysts, program managers and user support personnel who wish to learn the Python programming language.

## Introduction
The Python program is a scripting language that can be used for development, coding websites and applications, processing images, scientific data, and more. The program can be found in action on the Google search engine, NASA, Disney, Pinterest, and more. It was built for ease of use and speed and is less complicated than Ruby and other similar object-oriented programming languages. Because it is open-sourced, the program has enjoyed popularity among developers and programmers, and it continues to be the base program for most websites in operation on the internet today. 

Python software is free to download and can be accessed on virtually every type of operating system. It comes with a large standard library that will make programming simple tasks, such as reading and modifying files, connecting to web servers, and more, easy. companies such as Nokia, IBM, Google, and Disney were all searching for programmers with Python experience to help them with web applications and framework development; in this respect, Python works perfectly with Django, which functions as the base framework system that Python builds on. Python also enables programs to script professional-grade web-based products. From back-end to front-end development, full-stack, and web-based options, Python programmers continue to find more economic prospects as the use of the language grows to encompass all areas of
software and web development.

## Duration
